# Principal-Component-Analysis

-Principal component analysis is one of the data analysis methods and
most useful machine learning tools. It can be used for
identify patterns in very complex data sets.
They allow you to indicate which variables are the most important.
Finally, the analysis helps indicate to what extent the new understanding
data is accurate.

-PCA or principal component analysis is a dimensionality reduction technique
which can help us reduce the dimensions of the dataset we use
in machine learning for training. This helps solve the problem
dimensionality.
